# CryptoWeb-Toolkit
A web-based application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that implements classic cipher algorithms and (Beta) Simplified DES (S-DES) implementation for educational purposes
Features:

Clean, responsive interface for encryption/decryption

Real-time processing of user input

Detailed algorithm explanations with examples

Copy-to-clipboard functionality for results

(Beta) S-DES implementation with 8-bit block processing

Purpose:
Educational tool for demonstrating fundamental cryptographic concepts in a user-friendly web environment. The beta S-DES component provides an introduction to more complex block cipher operations.
